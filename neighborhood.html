            The Avenues neighborhood lies on the "north east bench" of the Wasatch Mountains in Salt Lake City. The north-south roads in the Avenues, which slope up the hillside, begin at Canyon Road and then are lettered from "A" to "U" Street and then "Virginia Street", from west to east. 
            The fairly level east-west roads are numbered 1st to 18th Avenues heading northward from South Temple Street. 
            The large Salt Lake City Cemetery occupies a significant portion of the eastern Avenues below 11th Avenue and abuts <a href="https://www.slc.gov/parks/parks-division/lindsey-gardens/">Lindsey Gardens</a> (park).
            The Avenues is also especially popular due to its proximity to downtown, the large and remote Memory Grove/City Creek Canyon recreation area to the west, the University of Utah to the east/southeast, and the airport, as well as low traffic and minimal commercial development.
